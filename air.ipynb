            "Tehran to Tabriz, and ATA Airlines used an MD-82. The aircraft have seen its better days long time ago. Flight from Tehran to Tabriz was re scheduled one hour later as originally but I got information upfront. Finally there have been another 45 minutes delay as there seemed to be a technical problem. During waiting it becomes very warm as the aircon was not working till departure. The return flight was in time. Seating is very tight especially when aircraft was almost full which was the case on both flights. Crew was friendly but English skills are limited. On both one hour flights they serve a lunch box, banana, juice, chocolate bars. However, when flying in Iran, ATA Airlines is one of the better airlines, there are no better alternatives on this route. Either you use them or take the bus or the train. \n",
            " Copenhagen to Sorvagur return. Wonderful experience, many smiles by service team, multiple drink refills, decent in-flight entertainment via own device and very smooth flight into Faroer. An excellent value for money and perhaps one of the last remaining airlines in Europe that treats customers as many did in the past. I got the impression that the team liked their job and were happy to welcome everyone on board. We pre-ordered delicious snacks and very comfortable seats. Flights were on time and a breeze, a perfect start into the vacation and back home.\n",
            " Copenhagen to Vagar in the Faroe Islands with Atlantic Airways (RC453). A319 aircraft. Friendly check-in, received baggage tag and headed to the gate. Flight boarded in an organized fashion and flight attendants greeted each passenger as you entered the cabin. Nice colors and comfortable seats. Lots of legroom actually - was very surprised. On-time take off and 2 hours to the Faroe islands - soda, water and coffee serviced complimentary but purchased wine and food was reasonably priced. Inflight entertainment was just the flight-map but had my DVD's to watch. Landed a few minutes late in crazy wind and rain, but the landing was good. Parked farthest possible on the tarmac from the entrance to the terminal so we all got wet, but that is how it is there. Bags off in a reasonable amount of time. Oveall a very good flight and for the price a good deal.\n",
            "I had two flights with Atlantic Airways. Flight Bergen- Faroe Islands and Faroe Islands to Copenhagen one week later. Both flights on time. Comfortable seats, clean aircraft, good food, friendly service. I will flight with Atlantic Airways again with pleasure.\n",
            "Copenhagen to Vagar (Faroe Islands), and the Atlantic Airways A319 was still quite new and had the feature of mood lighting (which you don't see on many European short haul aircraft). The cabin layout was very nice. The food was simple, but good : a nice little wrap, salad with fresh salmon, bread and little mini-Rittersport chocolate. Very surprised that only 45 minutes after the meals / drinks service they did a second drink service (a full aircraft on a 2.05hr flight!). The service was friendly and the lady who served me was most charming. A simple short haul flight, but very pleasant!\n",
            "The short journey was very pleasant, the staff were very friendly and the food on-board was excellent. I would recommend them to anyone flying to the Faroe Islands.\n",
            "I have flown Atlantic Airways numerous times between the Faroe Islands and Copenhagen. The flight attendants are some of the best around and they consistently go out of their way to ensure that passengers have a good experience. The new Airbus is more comfortable than the older planes. The airlines offers free alcohol and above average coffee. Food however is below average.\n",
            "Small company but very friendly and efficient staff. All passengers treated as business class travelers even though Atlantic Airways only offers one class (economy). Small planes (Bea 146 and Airbus 319) but the comfort is all right for the short trips between Scandinavian countries Faroe Islands and Britain.\n",
            "CPH-FAE return new aircraft on time friendly and smiling FA snack alcoholic/ non-alcoholic beverage served.\n",
            "Flew to Vagar Faroe Islands. Smooth flight lasting 2 hrs 15 mins each way. Flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Seats comfortable and spacious adequate storage space for inflight luggage. Free snacks served as well as alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.\n",
            "Flew on Atlantic Airways from Copenhagen to Vagar and return on economy on a BAe 146. A safe and smooth flight considering the north atlantic winds! Crew friendly and efficient and nice leather seats with an acceptable leg space. Would definately recommend this airline and would fly them again.\n",
            "  There are two options for getting from Dar es Salaam to Zanzibar – a two-hour ferry journey or a 20 minute flight. The main airlines flying this route are Auric Air and Air Tanzania. Ordering the ticket via Opodo was easy and the airline operates from Terminal 1 – a small building about 1km from the main terminals. Check-in was efficient and the waiting room had several powerful air conditioning units. You could even buy food and drink. Tickets were checked and we were walked across to the Cessna. It had three seats in each row and although tight it was not uncomfortable. It only had a pilot and we flew at about 3000 feet giving us a clear view of the sea and then the island. It ended with a very smooth landing close to the terminal.\n",
            "  I haven’t boarded just yet. Flight was cancelled by the airline. Been really looking forward to the flight as I’m visiting my family that I don’t get to see that often. What’s shocking is that in order to change the ticket I need to pay even though airline is the one who cancelled the flight and customer service is not available. On the phone queue for 3 hours already and no answer. I’m lost for words. Is there anyone at all who is willing to help or we just cash in these days! Disappointed is just understatement!\n",
            "  Gatwick to Guernsey on an ATR 72. This is a small plane, very small. So small in fact I banged my head upon entering the cabin. I'm 6ft tall and couldn't stand upright, seating was okish, the seat was comfortable enough but legroom was very restricted. Cabin crew were friendly enough and the flight was fairly short, around 45 minutes. Guernsey to Gatwick on an Embraer 195. This is a bigger aircraft, legroom was a little better but the seat was considerably more uncomfortable. Cabin crew were a little surly and again the flight was short, 30 mins, and uneventful. Aurigny, I believe, are the only airline that flies to Guernsey from the UK, so having a monopoly they aren't too concerned with customer service. BA, to my surprise, gave complimentary hot drinks and a breakfast bar on their Belfast city - Heathrow route. Aurigny charge £2.50 for a small cup of basic tea/coffee and if you want a breakfast bar or muffin with that the price rises to £3.50. Now consider that my BA ticket cost less than Aurigny. If another airline starts flying to Guernsey then they might start giving out complimentary hot drinks, until then they will continue to gouge the customer.\n",
            "  Flown this route return 4 or 5 times. Of course, a visitor to Guernsey has no choice, the airline has a monopoly. The flights themselves were only an hour, and uneventful. Aurigny flight team is usually OK. Not rude, but not terribly friendly, either. My last trip, the Guernsey airport staff was a very bad dream. They treated me like a suspected terrorist (I'm a past-middle-aged solo female traveler.) Kept me until the plane was completely boarded. I was the last one allowed on board. They opened my suitcase and removed every single item. They turned my book upside down and flipped the page, looking for who knows what. I fully expected sniffer dogs at some point. Since the trip itself had been stressful (horrendous weather, hotel room robbed), this last insult was so upsetting! I was finally allowed on the plane, but fighting tears. The flight attendant was nasty and gave me a \"look\" for holding everyone up.\n",
            "  Gatwick to Guernsey booked for late April. I am a US citizen who planned to vacation in the UK. With the Coronavirus, we had to cancel our plans. Every business that we preplanned and prepaid with has refunded every dollar even-though all our tours were labeled “non refundable“. Delta also refunded every cent! Aurigny, is the only exception. They told me use my travel insurance because they are not giving me a refund. Can you believe at this time, with this world pandemic emergency situation that this airline refuses a refund. Its not like I merely just changed my mind. Im not allowed to get to UK to take this flight from this airline.\n",
            " Aurigny has a monopoly on flights in Guernsey so you have no other option that to book with them. The staff on board the flight look miserable, like they do not enjoy working there at all. The checkin staff at Gatwick were ok but the checkin at Guernsey was bad, such grumpy staff. We were 2kg over on checkin which was quoted as going to cost 20pounds! We only had 3 carry-on bags (out of our limit of 4) and the plane wasn't full, so common sense would say just let it through. Instead we had to take the 2kg out and make a 4th carry-on bag. So the weight is still in our entitlement but what a pain! Then on arrival to Gatwick our brand new expensive Samsonsite suitcase had a huge gash on the front of it! I was shocked. There was no person at the baggage info desk at Gatwick (South Terminal). So when I got home and had a customer feedback email from Aurigny, I answered it straight away and told them about the problem. I got no response. I emailed Aurigny again after I returned home from my holiday only to be told: \"The online Survey that is sent out does not come from Customer Services. All claims have to come to this email address, and we have checked, and we definitely didn’t have any emails from you until yesterday. I’m afraid on this occasion we would have to recommend claiming through your travel insurance.\" To say that I am disappointed in this service is an understatement. I sincerely hope I have never have to fly on Aurigny ever again, nor would I ever recommend the airline! take the ferry from the mainland or fly to Jersey with another airline and then transfer to Jersey via ferry!\n",
            "  The flight was scheduled from Leeds Bradford to Guernsey at 14.15 on Monday 13 February and was cancelled once we had checked in baggage. No reason was given but we were bused to Manchester where we boarded an alternative flight at 1915. It was notable that there were no adverse weather conditions and regular travellers on the flight indicate that cancelling the Leeds flight is a regular occurrence in order to fill the Manchester flight - this seems a method of marketing the Manchester flight! Surprise surprise the Leeds Flight was also cancelled on Monday 20 February!\n",
            "We flew from Gatwick to Guernsey and no problem with hold baggage or cabin baggage. However, on our return, at Guernsey check in, our cabin baggage didn't fit in their tester 'box' (despite being bought as hand baggage size), so we had to take out the laptop, iPad and sat nav and put into a carrier bag. Other people were checking in with much larger rucksacks and hold-all whose owners weren't even asked to test if theirs fitted the tester box! If our bag was too large, then fair enough, the measurements were on the Aurigny website but where's the consistency and why wasn't it picked up in Gatwick? Not happy when all we can see in departures are massive 'hand baggage'!\n",
            " Norwich to Guernsey with Aurigny Air. Online service very good, when I was booking my seats 2 months after booking the flights I noticed I had spelt my wife's name incorrectly, but 1 email to aurigny put that right with no extra charge. The flight to Guernsey from Norwich was on time and landed early, the same when coming back. The flight had 36 people coming back so about 80% full, complementary drinks are served which made a nice change. The flight crew kept us informed through out the flight. I would recommend this airline.\n",
            "  We had booked our flights and prepaid for selected seats in February 2016. We chose to sit on row 19a and c on both flights. Flew out from Manchester to Guernsey on 2nd August 2016, flight had slight delay but nothing too bad. Service onboard was rushed, drinks and duty free served very early into the flight, then cabin crew sat and chatted for the rest of the flight. The return flight was a shambles. Upon arriving at Guernsey airport we were asked if we would like to change our seats, I declined this offer. Upon boarding at the gate I was given different seat numbers from those I had chosen and paid for. I explained to the gate staff that I had chosen my seats prior to the flight and wished to sit on those seats, the gate staff looked at me and told me to sort it out with the crew. Upon boarding the aircraft the stewardess was heard to say that the seats we had been allocated were in the same area of the plane, so could not see a problem. I stated that we required our chosen seats, which other passengers were sitting on. She did ask these passengers to move, which they did. If we had accepted the alternative seats, there was infact passengers sitting on these too. Again the drinks were served very early in the flight, but this time there was an announcement stating there was no hot water so only cold drinks could be served. Quickly after this came the duty free. The cabin crew spent the rest of the flight chatting to a passenger who also worked with the airline, talking very loud so that announcements made by the pilot could not be heard. I have flown on many airlines in the past, both scheduled and chartered. I feel that the price charged is very high, considering it is only a 70 minute duration, and the service offered is extremely poor. What is the point of giving passengers the option to pre-book and pay for seats it their request is not provided? I can now understand why Aurigny Air is receiving such bad press recently.\n"

            "Flew Air Nostrum from Melilla to Madrid. Was a business flexible ticket. Quality / price excellent. Ground service in Melilla is nothing special for business flyers. Just a different row for check-in. The seat comfort for a short flight (less than 2 hours) was OK even though for a business class you could expect more. Breakfast is served for free for Business class giving two or three menus. I had fruit and it was very well served with yoghurt / cheese. The quality was excelent. I asked for kosher food and this wasn't given. They said they do not have kosher menu but suddenly on my way back they brought me kosher food. No entertainment on board. Bathroom without hand towel. Cabin staff very kind.\n",
            "  Our direct SAS flight (to be operated by Cimber) from Vilnius to Copenhagen had been cancelled, so SAS re-routed us through Stockholm. The airlines between Vilnius and Stockholm turned out to be Air Nostrum. Seat pitch was the same as with SAS. Cabin staff did not speak any Scandinavian language nor Lithuanian, so announcements, including security instructions, were carried out in Spanish and English, and my wife and I didn't understand. Onboard we wanted to purchase some items, such as sparkling water and a sandwich. The purser then told that none of the goods from the menu card could be purchased. I thought that it was an SAS flight operated by another airline, and I actually expected SAS service. However, the only reaction to this was that they couldn't do anything, because this was Air Nostrum. I then argued that it said SAS on the ticket, and even the SAS logo was painted on the tail wing, but also this didn't seem to bother the purser at all. She said that all food/beverage services were only for business class. When my wife made it clear that if she actually did get sick during the flight, the cabin staff would have a problem, the purser got my wife sparkling water. \n",
            "Alicante to Madrid. Short flight to connect to a long haul flight. Ground staff were efficient at Iberia desk. As usual you have to leave larger carry on bags on the ground next to the plane and then pick them up on arrival next to the plane. Seats are leather and on a 2 by 2 basis in both business and economy. Service was adequate, leg room was adequate even for two over six footers.\n",
            "I have flown on Air Nostrum for the first time on a quick 1hr 40min flight from T4 Madrid Barajas airport to Marrakesh airport. It was a smooth and well organised operation. I had not flown on a CRJ1000 and discovered it is a very pleasant and smooth aircraft with the value added of no middle seats as it is a 2-2 configuration. Interestingly enough it appears that this subsidiary of Iberia is able to carry out a better, friendlier service and have nicer uniforms than its parent company. The flight was good, service was good, the communication from the pilot and stewardesses was good. The only thing that was not good (not the airline's fault by the way) were the screeching children that some parents were unable (nor interested) to control, who managed to run riot around the plane and disturb pretty much everyone in the flight, to the point that one of the flight attendants had to go around with the youngest element and ask passengers who it belonged to shortly before landing as the parents were clearly not too interested in the safety of their own child.\n",
            "Alicante to Madrid with Air Nostrum was a very good short flight. Checked in a few days before on line and got emergency exit seats at no cost.\n",
            "Madrid to Bordeaux IB8554 March 4 2015. This would have to have been the worst service we have had on any airline! We are Platinum / Emerald frequent flyers. Plane was an hour late and pax were kept on bus with no explanation insufficient meals for the only 2 business class pax - us! Pancakes and only other meal not quite frozen! No welcome on board no welcome drink for business class pax us! No cabin assistance unless we asked repeatedly. And finally just to add insult no response to our original complaint about this and we have to fly with this airline again unfortunately. If we had a choice we would not fly Air Nostrum.\n",
            "MAH-PMI return on ATR72. Both flights on time crew good. Prices seem steep for non residents of the Islands. Used Iberia/BA airmiles so only paid tax.\n",
            "28th August 2013 I took a flight from Malaga to Melilla. I found the ground staff to be very professional and well turned out. They were welcoming and conducted their duties with pride. The flight was on an ATR aircraft which is ideal for the relatively short flight from Malaga to North Africa. The flight departed on-time and the cabin crew conducted a safety demonstration. Bizarrely one of the cabin crew showed the food to purchase card but then said there was nothing to buy! The flight was suitably comfortable and arrived into Melilla exactly as per schedule. Disembarkation was well managed and orderly. Overall I had a good impression of Air Nostrum. The tickets though seem expensive.\n",
            "Smooth way through the airport of Madrid. Check-in done online. The best way to do it nowadays. Even though Air Nostrum operates from the K area in Madrid this flight was boarded by bus which is ok. Very positive is the fact that you can deliver your hand-luggage next to the aircraft and thus not check it in or wait for it at a luggage belt. The stewardess was very friendly and well groomed. In general the cabin crews of Air Nostrum are young and good looking. The old CRJ200 was noisy and small not my favourite regional aircraft. The flight was short and uneventful. The inflight service consisted of 'tu menu' which is in your seat pocket and from which you can buy 'Iberia' style snacks and drinks. Not too long ago this carrier still offered free of charge beverages and even snacks and sandwiches.\n",
            "Just learnt from an online check-in that my flight tomorrow from BCN to NCE was cancelled without them notifying me. They were not at all interested nor apologetic when I phoned for an explanation. I paid more to travel with them over the cheaper alternatives to avoid this situation. Such a short flight but it has cost me over 2K so far in re-routing around their failure. An email from them could have avoided so much trouble.\n",
            "MAN-MAD-MAN on a newish CRJ900. Business takes me to Madrid a lot and this new route replaces the stop at LHR and shaves 4 hours off the journey for me. Friendly efficient clean with nothing to grumble about.\n",
            "MAD-MUC on a newer CRJ-1000. As opposed to our terrible experience on Iberia for the earlier legs of this trip this was a night-and-day difference. Clean modern plane with legroom efficient FA's drinks and snacks served. Air Nostrum does everything so much better than its parent. If you are compelled to take Iberia flights make sure you use Air Nostrum for as many legs as you can - it really is a superior experience.\n",
            "Madrid to Porto. A relatively modern CRJ1000 (2+2 seating) offered more legroom than Iberia A320. Flight almost an hour late but this is becoming the norm at Madrid-Barajas so it's not a big deal. Crew pleasant and served drinks and a small packet of nuts on 1 hour flight.\n",
            "Madrid to San Sebastian on Canadair RJ 200. Just four business class seats on this 35 minute short-haul regional flight. Very friendly and attentive service with free drinks and filled rolls for business. Oversize hand luggage was put in the hold and could be collected on the tarmac at the destination. You wouldn't really pay for business on this regional airline as it's not really value for money for such short hops. But if you happen to travel in this class then it's very pleasant.\n",
            "Madrid-Murcia return. I've had a few flights with Air Nostrum now and find their flights reasonably enjoyable. Service pleasant and friendly from the FA (coffee served) and flights seem to leave on time. I was very impressed with my check-in at Murcia's small terminal and which involved ticketing right through to Tokyo using Iberia and Japan Airlines connections and the whole process was seamless and efficient. I'm not sure if I like travelling in CRJ 200s that Air Nostrum uses but that may be because on Air Nostrum at least I never seem to be able to get clean windows and am unable to see outside much at all. Do these aircraft ever get cleaned?\n",
            "MAD-NTE-MAD. We were bussed to the aircraft and boarded very efficiently. The only FA spoke perfect English and Spanish and broken French. CRJ200 series (50 seats) was clean. FA was very friendly. We were served a drink and a packet of nuts and then biscuits and another drink. FA also gave out activity books to kids and newspapers and magazines to passengers as required. Air Nostrum did very well considering Iberia's service.\n",
            "MAD-VAL-MAD. A very satisfactory flying experience with flights leaving on time. Nice comfortable leather seats well turned out and friendly cabin crew who saw to the needs of my grandson by providing a colouring book and pencils. Light refreshments and newspapers were also provided. A pleasant change from flying budget airlines.\n",
            "Porto-Madrid business class. Ridiculously small space in Business class the same very narrow space as in economy. There are just 8 business class seats but if full as in my case it is no joy at all and the service is poor too. The flight left in time it was short so endurable. On arrival in Madrid the luggage was off-loaded right beside the aircraft and we had to take it from there ourselves.\n",
            "Gran Canaria - Valencia return. Checked in online in both directions and only had to drop my luggage at the counter. Almost full CRJ 200 and must admit that it was a pleasure to fly with this airline. Comfortable leather seats emergency exit seat so plenty of legroom for a 6'4'' passenger like me (also noticed that the other rows of seats also had above average space) although the seats were a bit narrow due to the width of the plane rather than Air Nostrum seating. The two flight attendants were cheerful and helpful: a sandwich and beer was provided (more than adequate for the time of day and length of flight (2h30m). Infinitely better flight than Iberia via Madrid Air Nostrum will be my airlibne of preference for domestic flights in Spain.\n",
            "NCE to MAD on a full CRJ-900. Flight left on time even though the plane had two busloads to fill it up. Service not extraordinary. Hostesses served us drinks and cheese sandwiches flight landed on time even though took 30 minutes in order to stop to gate. Good airline worth the price (250 euros return booked 1 month in advance) but do not expect a great service.\n",
            "VLC-TFN. El avión impecable el servicio a bordo adecuado al tamaño del avion (bocadillos mini y refresco) coste economico y puntual. Este verano repito. Clean airplane the service on board adapted to the size of the airplane (mini sandwiches and refreshment) all at a very good price. This summer I will travel Air Nostrum again.\n",
            "I have travelled on Air Nostrum a couple of times and find their service very good. I find it more relaxing than travelling on other airlines. Food consists of a sandwich or cake.\n",
            "MAD-VLC-MAD in economy. MAD-VLC on Air Nostrum and VLC-MAD on Iberia. Maybe I was lucky but the experience was quite good. The flights both ways were on time and without any unpleasant incident. Connecting from Air Canada (Terminal 1 in Madrid) to Iberia (Terminal 4) was a bit of a trial. It took a good 15 minutes on the shuttle bus much of it on the highway. Air Nostrum used a Bombardier CRJ a bit tight for space. Service on this 50 minute flight exceeded my expectations. No inflight entertainment - none was expected of course given the small plane and short flight. The two FA managed to serve drinks and miniature sandwiches (an almost microscopic bun with a single slice of chorizo inside) although they had to rush to get it done. I was in the last row and the descent to Valencia airport was choppy - felt like a life raft in rough sea! Anyway service was pleasant and I give Air Nostrum full marks. On my return leg on an Iberia Airbus 320 the experience was also quite good although below Air Nostrum. FAs did their job and were reasonably pleasant. Clean plane with 3+3 configuration leather seats with lots of leg room. The flight was only half full and left about 15 minutes late but got to Madrid on time. The downside was absolutely no drinks or snacks of any kind except in business class. There was food for purchase but I didn't see a single person purchasing. No IFE or video demonstration of any kind. I had only carry-on so can't comment on baggage handling. Overall a good experience I would give Air Nostrum 4 star and Iberia 3 star.\n",
            "MAD-TOU-MAD on CRJ 900. The flight attendants provided a very good service. Even though the flight only lasted 50 minutes they did their very best on this time. The only bad thing was the announcements the flight attendant who was in charge didn´t spoke french. Maybe in flights that go to France they should speak a bit of French.\n",
            "FRA-ZAR-FRA economy on Air Nostrum for Iberia in mid-June. I was disappointed. The all-economy seating when booking had been altered to mixed configuration business and economy by departure date and the economy passengers seemed to get much poorer service and food than the one or two passengers in the little business class cabin. FAs on all flights also seemed to have a bad case of attitude. Maybe I was having a bad hair day but I found the service poor the flights noisy (in the CRJs) the windows almost impossible to see out of. So I was happy to finally land in Zaragoza and Frankfurt.\n",
            "MAD-NCE-MAD on Canadair CRJ900 a superb aircraft. It is in a completely different league than the parent company Iberia. A sandwich two small bottles of wine and a coffee on a 1hr 20 run served by friendly professional flight attendants. This is one very good airline and if you dont have to connect onwards onto an IB connection you will enjoy the experience.\n",
            "Tangiers-Barcelona on a Canadair operated by Air Nostrum - way better than Iberia its higher class and service is also better than Iberia. The whole plane was business class.\n",
            "Basel via Barcelona to Granada. The flights between Basel and Barcelona were operated by Air Nostrum although sadly since they've stopped flying to Basel. I think their service is nothing short of amazing. First of all on the return we were even given a hot meal. This was in economy class and the flight is less than two hours. Generally the quality of the food is good and the service in economy class is more like what you get in Business class on most airlines. The flight attendants were very friendly which only made the contrast to the surly unfriendly bunch working for Iberia seem even more unfriendly.\n",
            "  Horrible. This woman at security decided to make up her own TSA rules and took all of my souvenirs that the locals when purchasing assured me they would make it through security. Tiny hot sauce in plastic 2 Oz bottles. Anything glass that was empty. Cocoa farm souvenirs from green acres. Confiscated. Meanwhile, my multi purpose utility metal chingadera with a serrated edge was ok. Perfume in glass ok. Tiny hot sauce in glass not ok. I’ve traveled over 20 countries without issue with same items. Also tiny school backpack forced to check. Never do I have to check. While some passengers brought 2 to 3 times bigger bags on without checking. This agent ruined my otherwise pleasant experience in bocas. Don’t buy anything over there that’s not made of wood basically. Hate you Air Panama. I’ve included photos of huge bags twice the size of mine allowed on plane. Pat yourself on the back because you lost a return customer and did not make the flight any safer. Might sound petty but just left me with a bad experience that unfortunately overshadowed my good time.\n",
            "  Ground staff friendly and professional. Limited facilities at Albrook Airport but functional. Couldn't do online check in but was smooth at the airport. Older plane but was on time and smooth flight. No real on board service so take your own snack or drink after airport security. Flight was only 50mins so not a problem. Plane does have a toilet. It's not like flying a major international airline, but its a short flight and was a good experience. They even gave us umbrellas to walk to the plane as it had started to rain which was a nice touch. I'd seen other negative reviews so was pleasantly surprised how professional and polite their staff were. I'd use them again. It's difficult to rate the actual on board service because there really isn't any, no entertainment or food / drinks but it's such a short flight it's not that relevant. So I base my score on the overall experience. Good service and on time flights with friendly staff but in flight service not really offered.\n",
            " The plane was in a good condition even for an old plane. Both flights were on time. On the 50 minute flight there was no service. Staff of the airline were professional and quick at check in. No e-check in.\n",
            "  The worst airline I have ever been in my life and I travel 2-3 times a year on international airlines. This airline has excessive prices since it does not have much competition, internal flights in Panama have a similar cost to an international flight to the United States. Also their prices are excessive, they have a no reimbursement policy and if you get sick with COVID or some other disease and you cannot travel, they will not reimburse you a penny. I would never recommend such an airline. \n",
            "  Panama City to Bocas Del Toro. Arrived at the airport an hour before my flight to find out I was switched to a different flight two hours after my scheduled flight. They told me I was informed by email which was a lie. The Air Panama staff acted annoyed and placed me on an imaginary waitlist by literally writing me last name down on a blank piece of paper and told me to keep checking and of course there was no room on any earlier flight every time I checked. I recommend using Copa or really any other airline if possible. I am finally boarding my plane after three hours and I will update if more things go wrong!\n",
            "  Panama City to Bocas del Torro. After reading reviews i was not looking forward to flying Air Panama. But the experience i had with them on the day of the flight was nothing as to what has been written. Check-in was fast, there is no online checking available as far as i could find. The plane was an old Fokker 50. Boarding was fast, we had to walk from the terminal to the plane. Once in the plane you could see the age (and there was a nasty smell onboard). We departed 15 minutes early. The seats were comfortable and plenty of legspace. It was a 40 minute flight, a drink and snack were served by 2 friendly flight attendants. Air Panama get the job done and I didn't have horrible service described by other people. It was fast and efficient nothing more and nothing less, maybe an upgrade in their fleet could do magic for them.y.\n"
